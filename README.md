- 👋 Hi, I’m @MessyMaryMay, and yes it's a fake name. 
- 👀 I’m interested in bot development and using my software skills for naughty reasons. Afterall, we are adults (most of us physically speaking), and we have needs. I wish to use AI as facilitator for our sexual fantasies when we can't be with a physical partner.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI programming, teledildonics, cyberdildonics (which is the same goddamn thing as teledildonics if you ask me).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... maybe later. I have been in software development for many years (mostly using Java) if you need a second set of eyes.
- 📫 How to reach me by [my email, twitchy.jack@gmail.com](mailto:twitchy.jack@gmail.com).
